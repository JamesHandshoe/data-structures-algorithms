/**
 * Binary Heap Basics
 * 
 * Heaps are tree data structures and a binary heap is very
 * similar to a binary search tree.
 * 
 * Binary Heaps
 * -Each parent has at most two child nodes
 * -Are used to implement Priority Queues which are very
 *  commonly used Data Structures
 * -Are also used with graph traversal algorithms
 * 
 * MaxBinaryHeap
 * -Parent nodes are always larger than child nodes
 *  but there are no guarantees between sibling nodes
 * 
 * -Is as compact as possible.  All the children of each
 *  node are as full as they can be and left children are
 *  filled out first
 * 
 * MinBinaryHeap
 * -Parent nodoes are always smaller than child nodes
