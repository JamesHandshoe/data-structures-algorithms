// stacks are LIFO
// stacks must add / remove from the same direction
const stack = [];
// stack.unshift adds to the front of the array
// stack.shift will remove the first item in the array
// this is the way that we can create a stack with
// a JS built in array and methods

// stack.push and stack.pop is another way to handle this
// push and pop are actually more efficient regarding big O
// notation

// if efficiency is critical then DON'T use an array
